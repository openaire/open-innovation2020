# OpenAIRE-Advance Open Innovation call
This github repository is used to support the development of the projects participating to the OpenAIRE-Advance Open Innovation Call.

If you want to know about the winners, read https://www.openaire.eu/open-innovation-in-openaire.

If you are a member of one of the winning team, post your questions and requests by creating a new issue. Please tag it with the label of your topic and/or your team. Your "supervisor", i.e. your contact point for technical questions - see table below - will reply and, if needed, will introduce you to the member(s) of the technical team that can better support you. 
Frequently asked questions will be added in the wiki.
